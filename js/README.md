### A simple class grade estimator

This web tool will simply tell you how well you need to do after all existing assignments.

You can **lock** assignments to set the score you've or assumed to achieve, and it can calculate how much you need to do for other assignments.

You can even save and restore your grade status and revisit it next time after you got a new grade back.

This is just a fun (and sad every time I calculate my score) tool that I build for my use, but I believe it is adapable for most college courses.

Enjoy and happy studying!

**Notice**:
IN ORDER TO CALCULATE ASSIGNMENT ESTIMATION, YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE WEIGHTS OF YOUR ASSIGNMENTS ADD UP TO ONE!
